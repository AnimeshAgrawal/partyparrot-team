# partyparrot-team
Generate an entire team of party parrots!  

## Installation
The [face recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) package requires additional setup. All other dependencies are listed in requirements.txt 

## Usage 
Create a folder named `input` in the same directory as `make_parrots.py` containing the images of people. There can be multiple people in one image (each will still get their own parrot). The program can be run with `python make_parrots.py`; a new subdirectory named `parrots` containing the outputs will be created.
